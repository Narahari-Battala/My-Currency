# My-Currency:

This is a Currency Converter Application developed using Python. I have used API from https://fixer.io,
this API gives the latest currency conversion rates. I have also used this API for getting many other details 
like historical currency conversion rates, to compare two different currencies and to get the Currency Codes 
and countries corresponding to the currencies.  

All the results from the API will be in JSON format , i have parsed the JSON data and displayed the results 
in the application. I have used TKinter Library for GUI.

## Application Features:

1. User Can Compare two different currencies.
 
2. User Can select a base currency and set of currencies to which he want the conversion rates of base currency.
   If the user just selects the base currency , the coversion rates of all the currencies with respect to base 
   currency will be displayed. 
  
3. User can select a past date to get the historical conversion rates of different currencies.

## Future Scope:

1. This project can be extended using Data Analytics which helps predict the future currency rates.
